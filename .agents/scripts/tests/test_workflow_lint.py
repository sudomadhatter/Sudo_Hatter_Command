"""wf-lint: allow-encoding-literals — the fixtures below ARE mojibake, on purpose.

workflow_lint's checks must FIRE on real defects and stay quiet on look-alikes. Without
these controls a clean lint run is indistinguishable from a dead detector.

The encoding third case is the one that caught us: `sudo-prune-context.md` documents the
mojibake pattern inside a code span, so a naive scan flags the file that says "don't do
this". The budget cases guard the opposite failure - a check so loud (115 warnings about
history nobody will touch) that the one actionable line is never read.
